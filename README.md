## RHODONEAS
Python file that aims to plot a rhodonea for a given k. It is done through a simple algorithm, and allows the user to change some parameters that influence the plot. Also includes a pdf containing the proof for the minimum angle necessary to close the rhodonea.

### DOWNLOADING
The most straightforward way to download it is through github, either by downloading the whole repository or just the rhodoneas.py file. There's also a command line option for users using a web downloader tool such as wget:
* For the whole repository in a zip
```shell
wget https://github.com/MiguelSanchezP/Rhodoneas/archive/master.zip
```
* Just for the python file
```shell
wget https://github.com/MiguelSanchezP/Rhodoneas/blob/master/rhodoneas.py
```
* Just for the proof:
```shell
wget https://github.com/MiguelSanchezP/Rhodoneas/blob/master/Angle%20to%20close%20a%20rhodonea%20curve.pdf
```

### INSTALLATION
As simple as download the file and run it, in order to change some of the parameters just edit the first lines and change the desired variables (for more info take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/MiguelSanchezP/Rhodoneas/wiki/Home/)).
