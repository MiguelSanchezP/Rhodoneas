## RHODONEAS
Python file that aims to plot a rhodonea for a given k. It is done through a simple algorithm, and allows the user to change some parameters that influence the plot. Also includes a pdf containing the proof for the minimum angle necessary to close the rhodonea.

### INSTALLATION
As simple as download the file and run it, in order to change some of the parameters just edit the first lines and change the desired variables (for more info take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/MiguelSanchezP/Rhodoneas/wiki/Home/)).

### COMPILATION & RUNNING
As any other python3 file:
```shell
python3 rhodoneas.py
```

### DEPENDENCIES
This imports ```matplotlib```, ```time``` and ```numpy```. Normally this files are installed in the system if one is a developer of python.
